# Notes

There should be about 19 classes and 9 TA sessions (first Monday excluded). This means that we have 28 in-class sessions total before the reading period.


* We will have one midterm. It will take place on Monday, April 30 during the regularly scheduled TA session, 7:30-8:30 PM in SHFE 103.
* Read the lectures ahead of time. The lectures (from, e.g., QuantEcon or the Python Data Science Handbook) have hyperlinks to the appropriate text.
* Solutions to the homework will be posted in a separate GitHub repo, found here: https://github.com/econ-21410-sp18/comp-econ-hw-jbejarano1 

**Books Used**

* [Lectures in ](https://lectures.quantecon.org/)[Quantitative Economics](https://lectures.quantecon.org/), by Thomas J. Sargent and John Stachurski (QuantEcon)
